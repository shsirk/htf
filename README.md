# htf
Simple CTF like website developed for personal use.

Requirements- 
    1. Linux preferred - Windows with WAMP is fine
    2. MySQL
    2. PHP 5

Just move source to /var/www. create tables in mysql using sql_queries.txt file (database "hacktheflag") and browse - 

TODO:
    - so many things 

    1. use relative path everywhere for any file inclusion (this will make HTF to be put in any directory under /var/www, currently all files need to be on root)
    2. make it scalable

    - more to be added
